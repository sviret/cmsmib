# Goal: 
# Small macro showing how to read the info written by RECO_extractor
#
# Where is the main code?
# http://cmssw.cvs.cern.ch/cgi-bin/cmssw.cgi/UserCode/cmsmib/Extractors/RecoExtractor/
#
# How to use the macro?
# Once you have a ROOT file from RECO extractor put its name and adress at the beginning MIB_ana.cxx and compile:
#
# [%%]> make
# [%%]> ./MIB_ana
#
# This will produce two plots showing some interaction simulated
# in the detector area
#
# MIB_ana.cxx is just a simple basic example, you could adapt
# it to your need quite easily. If you have questions, just ask:
