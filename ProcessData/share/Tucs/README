The only two directories you should ever have to edit are:

workers - where you define 'workers' or processors to process data
macros  - the script that calls whichever workers you want

And you may want to look in:

plots - where your plots will be stored

But please do not modify the 'src' directory without discussing it with all authors.  The 'src' directory contains the basic framework of Tucs, and any modifications to this could potentially break everybody else's code.
